# weatherAPP
An app to display weather for a given zip code of an US city (currently based on Spring boot and later will be integrated with UI).

This project has a Spring controller to process request coming from UI.
Then a business logic to process the request that is coming from controller.
There is an external REST API call to 'open weather' using netflix which also helps us understand third party calls handling.
